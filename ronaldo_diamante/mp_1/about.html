      <h1 class="pb-3 text-success">About Panay Island</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        For most visitors to the Philippines, Panay is the island they land on
        in order to get to the famous White Beach on Boracay. But what does
        Panay have to offer? Think of it as distinct provinces, as the locals
        do. In the northwest, <strong>Aklan Province</strong> (which includes
        Boracay) is best known for hosting the amazing Ati-Atihan Festival in
        its capital, Kalibo. Northeast, <strong>Capiz Province</strong>, has
        long been known for the fishponds dotting its capital, Roxas, and for
        the seafood on nearby Baybay Beach. <strong>Antique</strong>, on the
        west coast, is the least developed province, making exploration doubly
        interesting; ecotourism is taking hold among its lovely mountains and
        crystal-clear rivers. <strong>Iloilo Province</strong>, to the east, has
        the most sophisticated city on Panay, and also the nearby island of
        Guimaras, with aquamarine waters and mango farms. All this can be
        stitched together by circumnavigating Panay on its excellent road
        network.

              Philippines. Its capital is Kalibo. The province is situated in
              the northwest portion of Panay Island, bordering Antique to the
              southwest, and Capiz to the southeast. Aklan faces the Sibuyan Sea

              Aklan is most well-known for Boracay, a resort island 0.8

              sand beaches and is considered one of the more prominent
              destinations in the country. The Ati-Atihan Festival of Kalibo has
              also been known worldwide, hence declared "The Mother of all
              Philippine Festivals." It is an annual celebration held on the
              third Sunday of January to honor the Sto. Niño (Infant Jesus). The
              festival showcases tribal dancing through the town’s main streets
              to the tune of ethnic music, with participants in indigenous
              costumes and gear.

              Philippines located in the Western Visayas region. Its capital is
              San Jose de Buenavista, the most populous town in Antique. The
              province is situated in the western section of Panay Island and
              borders Aklan, Capiz and Iloilo to the east, while facing the Sulu
              Sea to the west. Antique Provincial Capitol Building in San Jose
              de Buenavista. <br />
              <br />
              The province is home to the indigenous Iraynun-Bukidnon, speakers
              of a dialect of the Kinaray-a language, who have crafted the only
              rice terrace clusters in the Visayas through indigenous knowledge
              and sheer vernacular capabilities. The rice terraces of the
              Iraynun-Bukidnon are divided into four terraced fields, namely,
              General Fullon rice terraces, Lublub rice terraces, Bakiang rice
              terraces, and San Agustin rice terraces. All of the rice terrace
              clusters have been researched by the National Commission for
              Culture and the Arts and various scholars from the University of
              the Philippines. There have been campaigns to nominate the
              Iraynun-Bukidnon Rice Terraces, along with the Central Panay
              Mountain Range, into the UNESCO World Heritage List.

              <strong>Capiz</strong>, officially the
              <strong>Province of Capiz</strong> (Capiznon/Hiligaynon: Kapuoran
              sang Capiz; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Capiz), is a province in the
              Philippines located in the central section of Western Visayas
              region. Its capital is the city of Roxas. It is located at the
              northeastern portion of Panay Island, bordering Aklan to the
              north, Antique to the west, and Iloilo to the south. Capiz faces

              <br />
              Capiz is known for the Placuna placenta oyster shell that has the
              same name locally and is used for decoration and making
              lampshades, trays, window and doors. Likewise, the province is
              known as the "Seafood Capital of the Philippines"[3] and was among
              the top 15 most frequently visited places in the Philippines.[4]
              Capiz is the site of the famous coral-stone Santa Monica Church in
              the town of Panay, home to the largest Catholic Church bell in
              Asia. The bell was made from 70 sacks of gold and silver coins
              donated by the townsfolk. Measuring seven feet in diameter, five
              feet in height and weighing 10,400 kilograms or just over 10
              metric tons, the Pan-ay bell is popular among tourists visiting
              Capiz.

              <strong>Iloilo</strong> ([ɪlo.ˈilo]), officially the
              <strong>Province of Iloilo</strong> (Hiligaynon: Kapuoran sang
              Iloilo; Kinaray-a: Kapuoran kang Iloilo; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng
              Iloilo), is a province in the Philippines located in the Western
              Visayas region. Its capital is the City of Iloilo, the regional
              center of Western Visayas. Iloilo occupies a major southeast
              portion of the Visayan island of Panay and is bordered by the
              province of Antique to the west, Capiz to the north, the Jintotolo
              Channel to the northeast, the Guimaras Strait to the east, and the
              Iloilo Strait and Panay Gulf to the southwest. <br />
              <br />
              Just off Iloilo's southeast coast is the island province of
              Guimaras, once part of Iloilo but now an independent province.
              Across the Panay Gulf and Guimaras Strait is Negros Occidental,
              occupying the northwestern half of the larger island of Negros.
              Iloilo City, its capital, is the center of the Iloilo–Guimaras
              Metropolitan Area or Metro Iloilo–Guimaras, and is geographically
              located in the province and is grouped under the province by the
              Philippine Statistics Authority but remains politically
              independent from the provincial government. According to the 2020
              census, the population of the province (excluding Iloilo City) is
              2,051,899. If Iloilo City is included, the population is 2,509,525
              in total. <br />
              <br />
              Iloilo is renowned for its rich history and culture, which has
              resulted in the preservation of numerous old Spanish-era historic
              sites, including the Miag-ao Church, a UNESCO World Heritage Site
              in the Philippines, and San Joaquin Campo Santo, which, along with
              San Joaquin Church and Santa Barbara Church, has been recognized
              as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the
              Philippines. The northern portion of the province is noted for its
              white sand beaches and crystal clear waters, namely the Bantigue
              Sand Bar, the Tangke Lagoon, Cabugao Island, and Antonia Island,
              which are all part of the Islas de Gigantes. Sicogon Island,
              located to the south of the group of islands, is also a tourist
              island destination in the province that is slowly regaining its
              popularity after the stalled development caused by martial law in
              the 1970s.
